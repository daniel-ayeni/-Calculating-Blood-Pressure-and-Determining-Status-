The blood pressure code is a program that calculates the blood pressure of a person based on user input. The user is asked to input their systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, and the code then uses these values to determine the overall blood pressure of the person. If the blood pressure is within the normal range, the code returns a message indicating that the blood pressure is normal. If the blood pressure is too high, the code returns a message indicating that the person has high blood pressure. If the blood pressure is too low, the code returns a message indicating that the person has low blood pressure.
This code prompts the user to enter their systolic and diastolic blood pressure values, and then passes these values to the calculate_bp function. The function uses these values to determine the blood pressure status, and returns a string indicating whether the blood pressure is normal, elevated, or high. The returned string is then printed to the console.
